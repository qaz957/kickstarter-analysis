# Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
To analyse data from Kickstarter campaigns in order to choose an ideal funding goal and launch schedule.
## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The timing of the campaigns seems to have some variance based on when you start the intial funding goal. Based on the data for other theater kickstarters, it appears that between April and May there is a huge upitck in success. Based on these findings one could infer that with the change of season from winter to spring, theatergoers could be more inclined to go out to shows and therefore more eager to fund new projects with the prospect of going to see them. With this information, we can reccommend starting a theater-based Kickstarter campaign in the month of May.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The funding goal of Kickstarter campaigns has a noticeable impact of success trending towards trying to limit the amount needed to reach the funding goal. Kickstarters with and average funding goal of less than $5000 have a distinct advantage of acheiving success over campaigns that ask for more money. Over this price point, the data indicates that kickstarters have an equal chance of succeeding or failing. Based on our findings, we can reccommend trying to limit the overall expendature needed to fund Louise's play.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Due to the raw nature of this data, the challenge was to parse out the pertinent information that could then be used to draw results. The existing Kickstarter data wasn't sufficient and multiple new data sets needed to be extrapolated from the proivded data. The data needed to be categorized properly beyond the initial survey data as well as the dates for all the campaigns. We achieved this by separating into "Parent Category" and "Subcategory" so we could more accurately draw results tailored to the client's needs.
## Results
From our analysis, we can deduce that the ideal time to launch Louise's kickstarter campaign would be during the month of May and that the end of the year has the worst chances of succeeding. Louise should aim for a spring or summer campaign if possible. The cost, however could play a much larger role in success and Louise should keep her initial asking offer below $5000 if possible. While with this data we can predict the best probabilities of starting a campaign, we cannot predict the overall success of the projects after funding. Another possible analysis that could be performed would be the amount of money raised in the Kickstarter versus the number asked for. With that data we could predict how much money Louise could actually recieve over her initial goal. There could be a correlation between having a lower asking offer and receiving more than the goal. For example, do campaigns with a $3000 goal typically go over their goal and by how much. That way, Louise could have a more informed choice with the intial goal and perhaps could try a stepped goal approach with funding her project.
